# Face_Recognition_Project
Developed and implemented a real-time face recognition system integrated with a dynamic database using Computer Vision techniques. Leveraged state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve accurate and efficient face recognition in real-time scenarios.
Engineered a seamless connection between the face recognition module and the dynamic database, allowing for instant updating and retrieval of recognized individuals' information. 
This project showcased my proficiency in Computer Vision, deep learning, and database integration while addressing real-world applications.
